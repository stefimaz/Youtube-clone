        <p>Get ready for the most exciting SUV drag race we’ve ever run on this channel!<br><br>

            We’ve finally got our hands on the Tesla Model X Plaid, and it’s going up against the new Lamborghini Urus
            Performante, a Porsche Cayenne Turbo GT, an AMG GLE 63 and a BMW X5M!<br><br>

            So let’s see how they all compare. Starting with the X5M, it’s powered by a 4.4-litre twin-turbo V8 that can
            produce 625hp and 750Nm of torque. It tips the scales at 2,410kg, and it costs £121,000. Next up it’s the
            Porsche Cayenne Turbo GT, which is equipped with a 4-litre twin-turbo V8 that delivers 640hp and 850Nm. It
            weighs in at 2,200kg, and it costs £150,000.<br><br>

            Next up is the Urus, which also has a 4-litre V8, putting down 666hp and 850Nm. It’s both the lightest and
            most expensive car here, coming in at 2,150kg and £209,000 respectively. The GLE 63 S comes in with a
            similar engine, although it’s down on power compared to the Urus, producing 612hp and 850Nm. It tips the
            scales at 2,400kg, and it costs £124,000.<br><br>

            Finally, we have the most powerful car here, the Model X Plaid! Its electric motors combine to produce
            1,020hp and 1,020Nm, it weighs in at 2,500kg, and it’ll set you back £133,000.<br><br>

            Will the Tesla walk it? There’s only one way to find out… LET’S RACE!</p>
