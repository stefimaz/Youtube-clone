        <p>Welcome to the most incredible petrol v hybrid v electric drag race you’ve ever seen! <br><br>

            We’ve got Mat in the all-electric Tesla Model X PLAID, and he’s going up against the Ferrari SF90 and
            Lamborghini Aventador SVJ!<br><br>

            So let’s see how these three powerhouses compare. Starting with the Tesla Model X, it comes with three
            electric motors which combine to make an eye-watering 1,020hp and 1,020Nm of torque! But of course, this is
            a family-friendly SUV, so it’s not light, tipping the scales at 2,539kg!<br><br>

            The SF90 is much lighter, weighing in at just 1,570kg! In terms of power, it’s packing a 4-litre twin-turbo
            V8 coupled with three electric motors to produce an almighty 1000hp and 800Nm!<br><br>

            Finally, we have the Lamborghini Aventador SVJ, which amazingly is the least powerful car in this line-up,
            with its 6.5-litre V12 able to put down 770hp and 720Nm of torque. However, it's the lightest car in this
            line-up, coming in at 1,525kg.<br><br>

            This one is just too close to call! Can an SUV actually beat these supercars?! There’s only one way to find
            out… LET’S RACE!</p>>
