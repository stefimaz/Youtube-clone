        <p>It’s time for a Huracan Performante to face off against an Urus Performante!<br><br>

            Now, you may think the result is a foregone conclusion, but we want to see just how well the all-new Urus
            can compete against this little Lambo pocket rocket!<br><br>

            So let’s see how they compare. Starting with the Huracan, it’s powered by a 5.2-litre naturally-aspirated
            V10 that can produce 640hp and 600Nm of torque. It’s super light, coming in at 1,382kg, and one of these
            will set you back £215,000.<br><br>

            Then we have the Urus, which is powered by a 4-litre twin-turbo V8. This can produce 666hp and 850Nm of
            torque, and just like the Huracan it drives all four wheels. It’s super heavy though, coming in at 2,150kg,
            and a new one of these will cost you £209,000.<br><br>

            So will the Huracan win every challenge in this video? There’s only one way to find out… LET’S RACE!</p>>
