        <p>We’ve got the new BMW M3 Touring going head-to-head against on paper its closest competitor - the Audi RS4.
            Think this a forgone conclusion? Think again. This is a drag race with a difference.<br><br>

            So let’s see how the two compare. Starting with the BMW, it’s powered by a 3-litre twin-turbo straight-six
            that can produce 510hp and 650Nm of torque. It drives all four wheels, weighs in at 1,865kg, and the price
            starts from £85,000.<br><br>

            Then we have the Audi. It’s packing a 2.9-litre twin-turbo V6 under the bonnet, which produces 450hp and
            600Nm of torque. But while the BMW has the Audi licked for power and torque, the RS4 is lighter, weighing in
            at 1,745kg. It's cheaper too - costing £70,000.<br><br>

            So what do you think - easy win for the BMW or does Mat have something up his sleeve to give the Audi the
            advantage? There’s only one way to find out… LET’S RACE!</p>
